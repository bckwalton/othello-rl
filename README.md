# Reinforcement Learning AI Othello
Source README:
An attempted implementation of Q learning to play othello. Uses a simple fully
connected feed forward neural network and backpropagation for the Q function.

(This was done as a project for a class in neural networks at WMU.)

Edits:
Minor changes to visualization script and to weights handling in main.py
I plan to add a Deeper NN in Keras to this model, And to switch from a custom board to a OpenAI Enviroment.
